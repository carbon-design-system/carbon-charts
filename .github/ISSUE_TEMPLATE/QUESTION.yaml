        If you're an IBMer, we have a couple of Slack channels available across all IBM
        Workspaces:

        - #carbon-design-system for questions about the Design System
        - #carbon-charts for dev-related questions around carbon dataviz
        - #carbon-charts-design for design-related questions around carbon dataviz

        For non-IBMer's you can ask a question on our [Github Discussions board](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-charts/discussions/new) or join [our Discord server](https://discord.gg/KAECRaWdzE) to chat with Carbon maintainers and fellow community members.
