<PageTitle title="Alluvial / Sankey Charts"/>

<p>Alluvial, or Sankey diagrams, are a type flow diagram designed to show two indicators of a dataset and how records distribute among them, highlighting correlations.</p>
<p>Multiple blocks of two indicators can be placed next to each other creating a wider alluvial diagram but itâ€™s crucial to consider that this specific kind of chart does not show correlations between indicators that are not directly connected. This is usually emphasized using a different set of colors for each block.</p>
