Carbon Charts Svelte is unique among the component libraries because it is provided in source / unbundled form. This means when you build your Svelte app using it, you are compiling the source of Carbon Charts Svelte and its dependency, Carbon Charts. Carbon Charts expects to run in a browser environment. This will cause an error when using server-side rendering (SSR). To avoid this, configure Vite to prevent @carbon/charts from being externalized for SSR. vite.config.mjs Example using React Click Preview or Both on the lower left of the example to see the chart.

		text: 'Most data visualizations are rectangular charts, with two dimensions represented on a vertical and a horizontal axis. Rectangular charts are typically constructed with a set of common elements including a legend, axis titles, and navigation tools like a zoom bar and tooltip. In a circular chart, labels offer the percentage value of the whole for an individual category. When the graphic translation of the data is less than 3 degrees, a callout is used to clearly associate the label with the slice. If the data translates as less than 1 degree, a slice will not be rendered on the chart, the data would not be keyboard accessible or available in a tooltip either. The only way to see the data in this scenario would be via a data table, a feature that we’d like to implement for all charts to enhance accessibility. A key performance indicator (KPI) consists of a number with a single word description. Examples include “15,250 browsers”, “\\$1.3M revenue”, or “Total 450”. A big number inside the donut chart may be used to display a total sum or the individual count of a slice upon interaction. This element can also be used independently on a dashboard (though please note this component is still a WIP and not available outside the donut chart).',

		text: 'Carbon Charts uses a tabular data format. Each framework package exports a TypeScript type called ChartTabularData. This format accomodates all types of charts. Each element in the array is a datapoint. For ChartTabularData, dates may be provided in various formats: ISO-8601 date/time stamps, JavaScript Date objects and integers representing an epoch. These formats may be mixed in the data for a single chart. In the example above, the key property is the domainIdentifier used for axis labels. The value property is known as the rangeIdentifier. The domainIdentifier name defaults to the name key for string values and date for dates. The default name for the rangeIdentifier is value. While these default names may be used, the best practice is to explicitly set a mapsTo property in the chart options for each axis as shown below. Circular charts expect the rangeIdentifer to be "value". Grouping of data can be done via the chart options property data.groupMapsTo as shown below. Some types of charts support additional options related to the tabular data format. Bubble charts can use four properties per datapoint. The property bubble.radiusMapsTo configures the radius of the bubbles (default property name is "radius"). For Svelte, React, Vue and Angular, data is reactive.

		text: 'Rectangular charts have a single x-axis and y-axis label by default. If you have datapoints with rangeIdentifiers (value) that represent two different units of measure (such as temperature and currency), it is best to display the data with dual axes. The following example shows options for a dual axis Line chart. The horizontal axis displays dates. The left vertical axis shows revenue and the right vertical axis shows attendees. The left axis is defined as the primary axis via the main property. The left and right axes have a correspondingDatasets property that represents an array of domainIdentifiers. Axis charts have a scaleType property for their axes. A value of "log" will display that axis using a logarithmic scale.  To start at zero, or not to start at zero. This is potentially history@apos;s longest debate. As a charting library, we would like to support both directions, with the following recommendation. Always start numerical axes at zero for part-to-whole and comparisons charts, such as bar and area chart. Truncating the Y axis can distort the perception, making a small difference look big and significant.  goodFor bar charts, the numerical axis should start at zero. bad When an axis starts at non-zero, percentage differences between bars are exaggerated.  Line charts and scatter plots are less sensitive to this distortion because they are intended to communicate trends and not the relative size of the difference. In these cases, cropping the y-axis helps users more easily identify the direction of change.  For line charts showing stock market activities, the existence of peaks and valleys in trends is more important than the true size of the change. Never interpolate between periods when data is unavailable. Always label both the start and end point during which data is not available.  Sometimes, it is useful to skip part of the axis to bring data on the extreme ends into view without distortion. When the axis contains a break, use a sinusoidal line to replace the straight axis line. On the x-axis, the break can be fluid with graph area size, with a minimum width of 1rem. On the y-axis, we recommend using a fixed distance of 1rem for the break. If data is available during an axis break, re-style line segments to use 0.5px stroke and hide circles representing data points.  If data isn’t available between axis breakpoints, leave the area empty.  Never change axis ticks increments to accommodate data availability. If any form of axis compression is required, use the provided axis break styling to visually denote the compression. In time series, x-axis labels reflect the time increment in the data. When possible, use localized date and time format, or user preference. Otherwise, the chart defaults to the format presented below. Whenever data crosses into a new time cycle, such as a new day, month, or year, semibold the label to make it a “landmark” label to provide additional context for the labels following it.

By default, Carbon Charts assigns colors based on the number of data groups (eg. charts with four data groups will get the first of the 4-color palettes). Avoid using a color palette designed for a different number of data groups than the chart is rendering unless you have a variable number of data groups. A custom color range can be provided to be used within the color scale. To do this, define values for all data groups in your chart.

		text: "Context is everything. Dashboards will vary widely depending on the context they are designed for and must be carefully considered. Presentation dashboards show viewers the current status of key performance indicators (KPIs) relevant to the business problem. A good presentation dashboard provides a big-picture view of the data while serving as a guide for the audience to decide what areas they would like to focus on and explore. Examples include a car dashboard, a stock market ticker board, or a route map with the locations of nearby gas stations layered on top. Prioritize data by importance, then create a clear visual hierarchy. The most important data should have the highest contrast and occupy the largest area. Most people in the west read left to right, then top to bottom. This is known as the F-shaped pattern. Place the most important at the top of the page and follow the F-pattern for the remaining elements, finishing with the least important information. Non-essential information should be provided as needed. Design a dashboard to reduce a page's complexity by stripping away anything that could distract a user from interpreting the information. Always use consistent colors for each data set within a dashboard. White space either sets elements apart or brings them together to distinguish a point's priority. Space acts as a visual separator and guides a user's eye through a page. It provides relief and breathing room. According to research conducted by Human Factors International, white space increases comprehension by almost 20 percent. Exploration dashboards allow users to interact with the data to discover insights and identify patterns. Examples of actions a user may perform on data include search, sort and filter data, roll up, and drill down. Exploration dashboards are intended for people who seek to look beyond a primary view and have to be very interactive. Examples include financial reports with roll up and drill down capabilities or interactive maps that include zooming in and out. Others include business previews with a search bar and additional data available on demand like opening hours and reviews. All charts should use the same layout and spacing, and have legends in the same position relative to the charting area. Do not switch measurement systems, like imperial to metric. Mirror chart modifications like filter and zoom. When a user manipulates one chart, other charts showing related data sets should automatically update to provide multi-dimensional views of the user's action. Use annotations to highlight trends, averages, peaks, and valleys to provide additional information. Annotations should help users interpret fluctuations in the data. Avoid annotations that obstruct the view of data.",

These charts are particularly useful for visualizing the flow of quantities between different states or conditions, providing clear insights into the structure and dynamics of datasets. To create a comprehensive alluvial diagram, you can align multiple blocks, each representing a pair of indicators, side by side. This arrangement allows for the visualization of complex networks and relationships within larger datasets. However, it is important to note that Alluvial Charts are designed to show correlations only between directly connected indicators. Relationships between non-adjacent indicators are not typically depicted, which can limit their use in displaying broader interdependencies within the data. To enhance readability and differentiation, distinct color schemes are often used for each block. This color coding helps in distinguishing between different sections of the diagram, making it easier for viewers to follow the flow and distribution of data across various categories and indicators. Overall, Alluvial Charts are a powerful tool for representing interconnected data in a clear and visually engaging manner. Details on Alluvial chart options can be found here.',

They are similar to line charts but emphasize the volume beneath the line by filling the area between the axis and the line with color or a pattern. This filled area helps to highlight the magnitude of values over time, making Area Charts particularly useful for showing trends in data at a glance, such as profits, stock volumes or demographic information over intervals. These charts are beneficial for comparing multiple datasets to see how volumes change over time relative to each other. For instance, they can effectively illustrate the growth of multiple product lines in a business or fluctuations in resource usage in different departments. In designing Area Charts, it's essential to maintain clear, uncluttered visuals, especially when dealing with multiple overlapping areas. Options such as stacking the areas (Stacked Area Charts) or normalizing the data to show proportional relationships (Percent Area Charts) can provide different perspectives and insights into the data, depending on the specific requirements of the analysis. Area Charts offer an intuitive and visually impactful way to present cumulative data series, making complex information more accessible and easier to understand.

		text: 'Line charts are graphical representations of data points connected by straight lines. They are commonly used to display trends or patterns over time or across different categories. In a line chart, the horizontal axis typically represents the independent variable, such as time or categories, while the vertical axis represents the dependent variable, such as numerical values or frequencies. Each data point is plotted as a marker, and the lines connecting them provide a visual representation of the progression or relationship between the data points. Line charts are particularly effective for illustrating trends, fluctuations, or correlations in data, making them valuable tools for data analysis, forecasting, and communication. They are widely used in fields such as finance, economics, science, and engineering to visualize time-series data, track performance metrics, and communicate insights to stakeholders. Line charts offer a clear and concise way to convey complex information, enabling users to make informed decisions and derive actionable insights from their data.
