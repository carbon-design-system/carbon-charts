# `@carbon/charts`

> Carbon Charting components

## Getting started

Run the following command using [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/):

```bash
npm install -S @carbon/charts d3@5.x
```

If you prefer [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/), use the following command
instead:

```bash
yarn add @carbon/charts d3@5.x
```

**Note:** you'd also need to install `carbon-components` if you're not using a
bundled version of the library.

## Charting data & options

Although we will definitely introduce new models in the future as we start
shipping new components such as maps, Data and options follow the same model in
all charts, with minor exceptions and differences in specific components.

For instance in the case of a donut chart you're able to pass in an additional
field called `center` in your options configuring the donut center.

For instructions on using the **tabular data format**, see
[here](https://carbon-design-system.github.io/carbon-charts/?path=/story/tutorials--tabular-data-format)

There are also additional options available depending on the chart type being
used,
[see our demo examples here](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-charts/tree/master/packages/core/demo/data).

Customizable options (specific to chart type) can be found
[here](https://carbon-design-system.github.io/carbon-charts/documentation/modules/_interfaces_charts_.html)
