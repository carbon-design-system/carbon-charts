# Carbon Charts Vue

Carbon Charts Vue is a thin Vue.js wrapper around the vanilla JavaScript `@carbon/charts` component library. The charts are based on D3.js, a peer dependency. This version is for Vue.js ^3.3.0. For Vue.js 2.x support, please use `@carbon/charts-vue@latest`.

The required styles should be imported from `@carbon/charts-vue/styles.css`. Additional documentation is provided in the Storybook demos.

## Charting data & options

Although new charts will be introduced in the future (such as a choropleth), data and options follow the same model for all charts with minor exceptions. For example, in the case of a donut chart, you're able to pass in an additional field called `center` in your options to configure the donut center.
