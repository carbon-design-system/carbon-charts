# API (Vanilla JavaScript)

When initializing an object using any of our exposed chart types (e.g. PieChart), the object that you'll receive includes many useful elements inside it.

```ts
const myChart = new PieChart({
  data: ...,
  options: ...
})

console.log(myChart)

// RESULT
{
  model, // where we store charting data & options
  services, // globalized functions that can affect charting behaviour. (e.g. event listener dispatching etc.)
  components // internally used for arranging the charting layout, you can disregard this
}
```

<br/>
## Data updates
Data updates are done through the model.

```ts
const myChart = new PieChart({
  data: ...,
  options: ...
})

myChart.model.setData(...)
```

Similarly, `myChart.model.getData();` & `myChart.model.getDisplayData();` can provide you the full data that's stored or only the portion that's currently being displayed.

<br/>
## Option updates
Options updates are also done through the model.

```js
const myChart = new PieChart({
  data: ...,
  options: ...
})

myChart.model.setOptions(...)
```

Similarly, `myChart.model.getOptions();` will provide you with the options that are stored.

## What are services?
Services are globalized functions that have proven useful across the board. General tasks such as event dispatching, transition handling, DOM-related activities etc. are handled by services.

**Example:**

Event listeners can be added through the events service:

```ts
barChart.services.events.addEventListener("bar-mouseover", e => console.log(e.detail))
```
