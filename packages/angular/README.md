# Carbon Charts - Angular

Carbon Charts Angular is a thin Angular wrapper around the vanilla JavaScript `@carbon/charts` component library. This release is for Angular >= 6 and < 16.

If you need support for Angular 16 or higher, please install `@carbon/charts-angular@next`.

The required styles should be imported from `@carbon/charts-angular/styles.css` and `@carbon/styles/css/styles.css`. Additional documentation is provided in the Storybook demos.

## Charting data & options

Although new charts will be introduced in the future (such as a choropleth), data and options follow the same model for all charts with minor exceptions. For example, in the case of a donut chart, you're able to pass in an additional field called `center` in your options to configure the donut center.
