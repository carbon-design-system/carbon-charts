# Color palette
> This version relies on <b>Carbon v11</b>. If you're using Carbon v10, <a href="https://carbon-charts-0x.netlify.app" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">see the legacy demo site</a>.

Carbon charts recently updated the default color palettes for `@carbon/charts` to follow the new IBM Design Language data vizualization palette.
This means more accessibility and usability in terms of the color variants provided by the library.

> For more guidance on using the IBM Design Language dataviz palette, see [here](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/data-visualization/color-palettes/)

<br/>
## Using a default palette
You can add the following chart options if you want to choose a color palette option from the Carbon dataviz palette.
By default, carbon-charts will assign the first color option for the appropriate amount of data groups (ex. charts with 4 data groups will get the first option for the 4-color palettes).

```ts
const verySimpleBarData = [
  { group: "Qty", value: 65000 },
  { group: "More", value: 29123 }
] // bar chart with 2 data groups "Qty" and "More"

const verySimpleBarOptions = {
  color: {
    pairing: {
      option: 2 // use the second color palette option for 2-group charts
    }
  }
}
```
> Refer to the Carbon Design Website for the full index of color palette options (by group size).

<br/>
## Using a different size color palette

> Note: It is not suggested to use a color palette designed for a different number of data groups than the chart is rendering.

```ts
// line chart with 2 data groups "Saturday" and "Sunday" initially but expecting
// 3 data groups on some data loads when long weekend "Friday" or "Monday" is included
const lineData = [
  { group: "Saturday", sales: 65000 },
  { group: "Sunday", sales: 29123 }
]

const lineOptions = {
  color: {
    pairing: {
      numberOfVariants: 3, // use a palette with 3 color variants
      option: 2 // use the 2nd option of 3 color charts
    }
  }
}
```

<br/>
## Using a custom color scale

You're also able to provide a custom
`color range` to be used within the color scale.
You are expected to define values for _all the data groups_ in your chart. If less data groups are provided than the chart contains, it will
default to using the IBM Design Language dataviz palette.

```ts
const simpleBarOptions = {
  color: {
    scale: {
      "Dataset 1": "blue",
      "Dataset 2": "red"
    } // chart only has 2 data groups
  }
}
```
